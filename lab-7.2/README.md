# Exercise 7.2 Docker networking

We will use docker networking and see how it is configured in a container.

### Step 1

Connect to the Google Compute Engine virtual machine.

You will need two SSH sessions for this exercise.

### Step 2

Change to the exercise directory.  
`cd`  
`cd devops-lesson-7/lab-7.2`  

Create a Centos Docker container and install net-tools.
`docker run -it --name centos centos /bin/bash`  
`yum install -y net-tools`  

Check the IP address and hostname.  
`ifconfig`  
`cat /etc/hosts`  
`hostname`  

Exit the container using control-D.  

Commit the container to an image.  
`docker commit centos centos-net`  
`docker images`  
`docker rm centos`  

### Step 3

Create a bridge network and find its IP range.  
`docker network create exnet`  
`docker network ls`  
`docker network inspect exnet`  

Run the centos container with the new network.  
`docker run -it --rm --network exnet centos-net /bin/bash`  

Check the IP address and hostname.  
`ifconfig`  
`cat /etc/hosts`  
`hostname`  

Exit the container with control-D.

### Step 4

Start a new container using the default network.  
`docker run -it --rm --name centos centos-net /bin/bash`  

Check the IP address and hostname.  
`ifconfig`  
`cat /etc/hosts`  
`hostname`  

From the second SSH windows connect the network to the container.  
`docker network connect exnet centos`  

Go back to the running container and see that it now has two IP addresses.  
`ifconfig`  
`cat /etc/hosts`  
`hostname`  

Go to the scond SSH window and disconnect the network.  
`docker network disconnect exnet centos`  

Go back to the running container and see that it now has one IP address.  
`ifconfig`  
`cat /etc/hosts`  
`hostname`  

Exit the container with control-D.
