# DevOps lab 7.1 Mocking

Setup a Mocking framework environment.

### Step 1

Go to Compute Engine and VM Instances. Start the VM if it isn’t running and connect using SSH.

### Step 2

Check out the code for the lesson.

`cd`  
`git clone https://github.com/simplilearn-devops/devops-lesson-7`  
`cd devops-lesson-7/lab-7.1`  

### Step 3

Start the vncserver.

`vncserver`  


### Step 4

Start the VNC client on your local machine. You will need the external IP address of your virtual machine. Enter the following into the VNC client replacing x.x.x.x with your IP address. Note that the external IP address can change every time you start the virtual machine.

`x.x.x.x:5901`  

If you are using a Mac enter the following into Safari replacing x.x.x.x with your IP address.

`vnc://x.x.x.x:5901`  

Dismiss any warnings about insecure connections.

The password is `simplilearn`.

You will be connected to the graphical desktop of the virtual machine.
